# How custom blocks can be stored. Valid options are "yaml" and "mysql"
#
# "yaml" will store all custom blocks in the file blocks.yml

# "mysql" will store all custom blocks in a MySQL database. You
# must provide the credentials for this database below under blockStorageMySQL
#
# If you were previously using YAML storage and would like to switch to MySQL,
# change this to MySQL and enter the information under blockStorageMySQL below.
# Then, restart your server, and run the command "customitems blockstorage migrate MySQL" FROM THE CONSOLE.
# Once you verify that you would like to migrate from YAML to MySQL, everything will be migrated.
# Likewise, to migrate from MySQL to YAML, run "customitems blockstorage migrate YAML" from the console.
# Be careful! Migrating will slow down your server a lot, and could crash it if you don't have enough RAM allocated.
