# (see "referencing items" in either items/compressedCobblestone.yml or on the wiki at
# https://github.com/jojodmo/CustomItems/wiki/Custom-Item-Reference if you're unsure how to do this)
#
# For example, you could make a new custom item that looks like a back button, and use
# that for previousMenu
