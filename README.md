# Bakrum Minecraft Server

Welcome to the repository for the **Bakrum Minecraft Server**! Bakrum was a semi-RPVP-faction server running on Minecraft 1.14.4. 
The server aimed to enhance the vanilla Minecraft experience by adding numerous features while preserving the original charm of the game. 
Created and improved by our dedicated staff, Bakrum provided a rich and engaging gameplay experience during its active period.
We created this project when we where 13 years old so there could be some basic problems like typographical error.
